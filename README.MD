# Microturbine Simulation Capstone - University of Washington Bothell
Created by: Casey Barnett, Steven Do, and Jason Ginos

## Background
This repository was made for our senior capstone project for the 2020-21 UWB academic school year. It contains MATLAB, Simulink, and Excel files that are used in conjunction to simulate a home-installed microturbine generator. The main goal for this simulation was to provide a visual demonstration for future engineering students on how power generation system components interact with each other to produce usable output power. Specifically, the simulated microturbine operates on the Brayton cycle to produce mechanical power that is fed into a synchronous generator to convert mechanical to electrical power. Concepts involved for this project include: thermodynamics, electric power, simulation, and machine design. See attached file for prior documentation of this project which includes more detail of its background and development.

## How to Install
To successfully run this simulation, the following will be needed to be downloaded:

- Files contained in the repository
- MATLAB 2020 or newer (Older versions have not be tested)
- Simulink
- All Simscape packages

All of the files downloaded from this repository will be needed to be placed in the same folder, as the simulation will reference and pull necessary data from the files in the folder. Once this has been completed, open the "Microturbine_
