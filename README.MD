# University of Washington-Bothell Microturbine Simulation Capstone
Authors: Casey Barnett, Steven Do, Jason Ginos

## Background
This repository contains MATLAB and Simulink files that are used in conjunction to simulate a home-stalled microturbine generator. The main goal for this simulation was to provide a visual demonstration for future engineering students on how power generation system components interact with each other to produce usable electrical power. Specifically, the simulated microturbine operates on the Brayton cycle to produce mechanical power that is fed into a synchronous generator to convert the mechanical power to electrical power.
